## Dotfiles

On the one hand, it's super nice to be able to use text files to configure
applications, etc. On the other hand, it becomes quite a task when you use
multiple machines and want to keep everything in sync.

Currently, I'm using a couple of hand-written Shell scripts to manage my
dotfiles ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/clmay/dotfiles)).

Lots of people make full-on CLI utilities to manage their dotfiles... seems
overkill to me. Lately, I found some folks who are just using git repos, and
this appeals to my sense of simplicity. Below are links to articles, blog posts,
tutorials, etc. that I hope will inform my future approach to dotfiles
management.

And, just a note for myself here... there's another one about storing dotfiles
in a git repo using the "bare directory" flag, or something, that I want to look
up and add to this list.
