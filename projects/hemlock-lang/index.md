## Hemlock programming language

_Programming without surprises_

Hemlock is a functional programming language that emphasizes readability,
performance, and safety.

It has the following features:

- Pattern matching
- Immutability by default
- Referential transparency
- Disciplined side effects
- Readable, consistent syntax
- Homoiconicity and hygienic macros

And a batteries-included philosophy:

- Dependency management
- Concurrency & parallelism
- Full-featured toolchain:
  - Linter
  - Formatter
  - Dependency manager
- Desktop, mobile, web, cloud support
- Literate programming support

Hemlock is rare among programming languages

### The Hemlock Philosophy

- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Words are easier to type than symbols and abbreviations, and easier to read.
  Reading and writing Hemlock code should be as easy as reading and writing
  prose.
