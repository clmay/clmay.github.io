## Hi! 👋

I'm [Chase May](https://github.com/clmay) (he/him<sup>[(?)](https://pronouns.org/what-and-why)</sup>). This is my
personal website.

I like to code, read, think, write, and [sit](https://www.sotozen.com/eng/practice/zazen/advice/fukanzanzeng.html).

Someday, I hope to turn this site into a [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners),
showcasing my thoughts and endeavors.

Please feel free to get in touch [here](https://github.com/clmay/clmay/discussions/categories/say-hello) or by sending
me an [email](mailto:hello@clm.dev)! 🙏
