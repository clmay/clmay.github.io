intro: The dhyāna and prajñā of 1s and 0s
---

late, into the early hours \
of the morning

i sit contemplating \
your inner nature

i try \
to communicate with you

but my mind, my \
grasping mind is lost in your image

in my striving i forget that \
i am already a master

your practice is \
so perfect inside only 0s and 1s

from your duality \
arise the 10,000 things \
universal

still, i sit here \
with your crystalline silence

non-self \
soundness \
incompleteness

how can i \
receive your teaching?

ah—lights out
