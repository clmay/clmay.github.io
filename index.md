## Hello!

I'm Chase. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/clmay) working ~~in Salt
Lake City, Utah~~ remotely for now. I'm originally from Oregon. At work, I
develop automated tests and testing infrastructure with **Ruby**.

For personal projects, I enjoy working with **Elixir**, **Rust**, and
**Svelte**. I'm particularly interested in solving hard backend problems,
building APIs, microservices, and distributed systems.

If you're with a company that's **hiring remote workers** or **Elixir
engineers** in any of the following places,
[drop me a note](mailto:p5j35nbue@relay.firefox.com) and let's talk!

- Eugene, Oregon
- Portland, Oregon
- Seattle, WA
- Vancouver, BC
- Germany
