## Hi there 👋

I'm [Chase](https://github.com/clmay).

I like to code, read, think, write, and
[sit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza).

Perhaps you'd like to see my [résumé](https://registry.jsonresume.org/clmay) (or as [JSON](https://gist.github.com/clmay/0b22b72508e2d3bdb8f3d7ac5fa87369))?

Someday, I hope to turn this site into a digital garden, showcasing my output and endeavors. For now, you get this page.
Oh, and ~~a couple~~ ~~well actually~~ one other one, too:

- [Talks](https://clm.dev/talks/)
- [Writing](https://clm.dev/writing/) (Coming soon!™)

Please feel free to get in touch by opening [an issue](https://github.com/clmay/clmay/issues/new) or sending me
[an email](mailto:hello@clm.dev)! 🙏
