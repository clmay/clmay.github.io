## Hello!

This is [my](https://github.com/clmay) personal web notebook, organized as a
wiki of sorts. This is the space where I organize all of my digital information.

Below, I've ranked things more or less by how interesting I think strangers are
to find them; the further you scroll, the less relevant things are likely to
seem.

You can learn a bit about my:

- [Interests](interests.md),
- [Projects](projects.md),
- and [Things I use](uses.md).

I've written a whopping one (1) tutorial so far, but I'm hoping to expand this
more as I run across things that I find more difficult than they should be.

- [Tutorials](tutorials.md)

I also like to keep track of ideas I have. These are things that I hope, one
day, to bring into the world, in one form or another. Some are ideas for
software projects or communities I want to build, some are just musings and
half-thoughts.

- [Ideas](ideas.md)

I also keep track of some bookmarks to other sites. I have a collecting problem,
but unlike most packrats, I like to hoard ideas rather than stuff. Some of these
sites are resources that I reference regularly, some are inspiration, others are
things I came across one time that I thought I might want to come back to later.

- [Bookmarks](bookmarks.md)

Finally, there are some documents here that I maintain more or less for my own
use; at least, I'm not sure why anyone else would be interested in them.
Nevertheless, they're here and available

- [Todos](todos.md)
