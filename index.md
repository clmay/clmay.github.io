## Hello!

I'm Chase. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/clmay) who lives in
Ogden, Utah, but I'm originally from Roseburg, Oregon.

My interests are diverse. I like to work with JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, and
Svelte. In my free time, I like to explore creative coding, functional
programming, and type theory. I also like to think, write, hike, and
[sit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza).

If you're with a company that's hiring for:

- Any engineering position that is **fully remote**
- Any engineering position based in **Eugene, Oregon**

then [drop me a note](mailto:hire@clm.dev) and let's talk!

On this site, you can find my:

- [Interests]({% link interests/index.md %})
- [Ideas]({% link ideas/index.md %})

Feel free to [email me](mailto:hello@clm.dev). If you notice any typographical,
grammatical, or factual errors, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/clmay/clmay.github.io/issues/new).
