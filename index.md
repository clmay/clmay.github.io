## Hi there 👋

I'm [Chase](https://github.com/clmay).

I like to code, read, think, write, and [sit](https://www.sotozen.com/eng/practice/zazen/advice/fukanzanzeng.html).

Someday, I hope to turn this site into a digital garden, showcasing my thoughts and endeavors. For now, you get this page.

Please feel free to get in touch [here](https://github.com/clmay/clmay/discussions/categories/say-hello) or by sending
me an [email](mailto:hello@clm.dev)! 🙏
