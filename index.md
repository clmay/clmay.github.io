## Hello!

I'm Chase. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/clmay) working ~~in Salt
Lake City, Utah~~ remotely for now. I'm originally from Oregon. At work, I
develop automated tests and testing infrastructure with Ruby and Docker.

For personal projects, I enjoy working with Elixir, Go, Rust, and
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev)!). I'm particularly interested in solving hard
backend problems, building APIs, microservices, and distributed systems.

If you're with a company that's hiring engineers for remote work or in any of
the following places, [drop me a note](mailto:clmay@hey.com) and let's talk!
