## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chase. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/clmay) who lives in
Ogden, Utah. I'm originally from Roseburg, Oregon. I like to work with
**JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **Svelte**. In my free time, I also
like to think, write, and [sit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza).

If you're hiring for a **fully-remote company** (or one based in **Eugene,
Oregon**), and you're interested in hiring me (ðŸ¤ž),
[drop me a note](mailto:hire@clm.dev) and let's talk!

On this site, you can find my:

grammatical, or factual errors, please
