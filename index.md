## Hello!

I'm Chase. I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/clmay) working ~~in Salt
Lake City, Utah~~ remotely for now. I'm originally from Oregon. At work, I
develop automated tests and testing infrastructure with **Ruby**.

For personal projects, I enjoy working with **Elixir**, **Rust**, and
**Svelte**. I'm particularly interested in solving hard backend problems,
building APIs, microservices, and distributed systems.

If you're with a company that's hiring engineers,
[drop me a note](mailto:hire@clm.dev) and let's talk! I'm interested in the
following:

- Elixir jobs (willing to relocate for the right opportunity)
- Any engineering position that is fully remote
- Any engineering position based in Eugene, Oregon

On this site, you can find my:

Feel free to [email me](mailto:hire@clm.dev). If you notice any typographical,
grammatical, or factual errors, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/clmay/clmay.github.io/issues/new).
