## Hi there 👋

I'm [Chase](https://github.com/clmay).

I like to code, read, think, write, and
[sit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikantaza).

Someday, I hope to turn this site into a digital garden, showcasing my output and endeavors. For now, you get this page.
Oh, and a ~~couple~~ (well) one other~~s~~, too:

- [Talks](https://clm.dev/talks/)
- [Writing](https://clm.dev/writing/) (Coming soon!™)

Feel free to [email me](mailto:hello@clm.dev). I'd be grateful if you would
[file an issue](https://github.com/clmay/clmay.github.io/issues/new) if you
notice any typographical, grammatical, or factual errors. 🙏
