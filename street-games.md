# Street games

> A street game is a sport or game that is played on city streets rather than a
> prepared field. Street games are usually simply play time activities for
> children in the most convenient venue. However some street games have risen to
> the level of organized tournaments, such as stickball.

> When street games are based on organized sports the rules are usually highly
> modified to fit the situation, i.e. manhole covers for bases with cars or
> buildings for foul lines in stickball. When balls are used in street games,
> spaldeens are often used.
