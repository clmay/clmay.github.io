# clmay/wiki

My personal hypertext web notebook. A simple collection of Markdown documents,
rendered and served by GitHub Pages, available at https://clmay.github.io/wiki/.

## Conventions

- All pages should be titled with `##`/H2 headings
- TOCs are separated from page content with `---` (horizontal rule)
- Page footers (a la Wikipedia) are also separated from page content with `---`
- Page footers should include a link to the parent page
- Page footers may also optionally include a list of #tags
