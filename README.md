# clmay.github.io

My personal website and wiki. A simple collection of Markdown documents,
rendered and served by GitHub Pages, available at https://clm.dev.

## Conventions

- Headings in body content should begin with `##` / `<h2>` to avoid conflicts
  with page titles
- TOCs are separated from page content with `---` (horizontal rule)
- Page footers (Ã  la Wikipedia) are also separated from page content with `---`
