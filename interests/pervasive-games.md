## Pervasive games

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervasive_game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervasive_game)

> A pervasive game is a Video, Role Playing (RPG), or Live Action Role Playing
> (LARP) game where the gaming experience is extended out in the real world, or
> where the fictive world in which the game takes place blends with the physical
> world. The "It's Alive" mobile games company described pervasive games as
> "games that surround you", while Montola, Stenros and Waern's book, Pervasive
> Games defines them as having "one or more salient features that expand the
> contractual magic circle of play spatially, temporally, or socially." The
> concept of a "magic circle" draws from the work of Johan Huizinga, who
> describes the boundaries of play.
