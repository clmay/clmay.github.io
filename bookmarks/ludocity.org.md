## Ludocity

[http://ludocity.org](http://ludocity.org)

> Ludocity is a collection of
> [pervasive games](../interests/pervasive-games.md),
> [street games](../interests/street-games.md) and new sports - social forms of
> play that take place in public spaces, such as city streets, parks and public
> buildings.

> Some of the games on Ludocity overlap with theatre, painting, dance, and other
> art forms. Some of them use balloons, lumps of coal, huge sheets of paper, mp3
> players, elaborate costumes, and short-range radio broadcasts. All of them
> have had their rules released under a creative commons licence, giving
> everyone permission to run that game for free, wherever and whenever they
> like.
