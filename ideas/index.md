## awesome-radleft

[awesome-radleft](https://github.com/radleft/awesome-radleft) is a project to
create an index of resources for radical leftists: organizations, tactics,
notable people, etc. I've looped my buddy Brian into this, and it's open to
other contributors, as well.

## Hemlock programming language

I've been interested in programming language theory and design since I learned
how to program. "Hemlock" is a (currently) hypothetical functional programming
language. For now, I've fleshed out a list of features and design principles,
but there's not much more than that. Still, if you're interested, have a look at
the [current draft]({% link ideas/hemlock-lang/index.md %}).

## radleft.news

I'd like to build the equivalent of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com),
but for radical left politics. Something to build a pluralistic leftist
community _outside_ of corporate silos like Reddit, Facebook, etc.
